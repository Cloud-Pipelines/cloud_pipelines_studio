The Published Components Library enables teams to share, discover, and maintain reusable components across workspaces. This guide walks you through the essential workflows for publishing, discovering, and maintaining components.

## Overview

The Published Components Library provides a centralized repository where teams can:

- **Share** tested and documented components
- **Discover** components created by team members
- **Maintain** component versions with seamless upgrades
- **Ensure quality** through validation checks

:::tip
Published components are shared across your entire workspace, making it easy for teams to collaborate and reuse proven solutions.

## Publishing Components

Transform your local components into reusable workspace assets through the publishing workflow.

### Steps to Publish

1. **Add your component** to the Pipeline Editor canvas
   - Drop a new component onto the canvas
   - Ensure it's fully configured and tested

2. **Navigate to User Components folder in the left panel**
   - Locate your component in the "User components" folder
   - Click on the component info icon (ⓘ) to open the component info dialog

3. **Access the Publish Tab**
   - Click on the "Publish" tab in the component panel
   - Review the component details and metadata

4. **Quality Validation**
   - The system automatically checks:
     - Documentation completeness
     - Required metadata fields
     - Component structure validity
   - Address any validation issues before proceeding

5. **Confirm Publication**
   - Review the publication summary
   - Click "Publish component" button
   - Your component is now available to all workspace users

:::warning
Once published, components cannot be deleted to ensure pipeline stability. Instead, publish new versions to update functionality.

### Best Practices for Publishing

| Practice                   | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complete Documentation** | Include clear descriptions, parameter explanations, and usage examples |
| **Semantic Naming**        | Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the component's purpose    |
| **Version Tags**           | Add meaningful tags to help users understand version changes           |
| **Test Thoroughly**        | Validate your component in different scenarios before publishing       |

## Discovering Components

Find and integrate published components quickly using the search and discovery features.

### Search and Add Components

1. **Use the Search Bar**
   - Type keywords in the component search input
   - Filter by name or author
   - Results update in real-time

2. **Drag to Canvas**
   - Select your desired component from search results
   - Drag it directly onto the Pipeline Editor canvas
   - Configure parameters as needed

:::tip
Use descriptive search terms like "data preprocessing" or "model training" to find relevant components faster.

## Releasing New Versions

Keep your published components up-to-date with the versioning workflow.

### Update Process

1. **Load the Updated Component**
   - Drop the new version onto the Pipeline Editor canvas
   - Make necessary modifications and improvements

2. **Access the Component**
   - Navigate to "User components" in the sidebar
   - Select the component you're updating

3. **Release New Version**
   - Click the "Publish" tab
   - Click "Release new version" button
   - Add version notes describing changes

:::warning
Breaking changes should be clearly documented in version notes to help users migrate smoothly.

## Receiving Component Upgrades

Stay current with automatic upgrade notifications and guided update flows.

### Automatic Detection

The system checks for component updates on every page refresh:

- Scans all components in your pipelines
- Identifies available upgrades
- Notifies you of update opportunities

### Upgrade Workflow

1. **Review Notification**
   - Look for the upgrade indicator on page load
   - Click the "Review" button when updates are available

2. **Follow Guided Update**
   - Review changes between versions
   - Check compatibility notes
   - Preview impact on your pipeline
   - Apply updates selectively or all at once

3. **Validate Changes**
   - Test pipeline after updates
   - Verify parameter mappings
   - Check for any deprecation warnings

:::tip
You can choose to skip the upgrade for curtain tasks by clicking the "Skip" button. You can use different component versions for different tasks in the same pipeline.

## Best Practices

### For Publishers

- **Document thoroughly**: Include examples and edge cases
- **Version responsibly**: Use semantic versioning
- **Communicate changes**: Write clear release notes
- **Maintain backward compatibility**: When possible

### For Consumers

- **Review before updating**: Check release notes and breaking changes
- **Test in development**: Validate updates before production
- **Pin versions**: For critical pipelines that need stability
- **Report issues**: Help improve components by providing feedback

## Troubleshooting


| Issue                                 | Solution                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Validation fails during publish**   | Review documentation and required fields           |
| **Component not appearing in search** | Wait a few moments for indexing, refresh page      |
| **Conflicts during update**           | Review parameter mappings and adjust manually      |

:::warning
Always backup your pipeline configuration before applying major component updates, especially in production environments.
